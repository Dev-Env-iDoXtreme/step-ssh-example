# step-ssh-example
This repo contains a showcase of how to use ssh certificates (for hosts & users) generated by [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) using the `step` CLI's `ssh` sub-command. It will show:

* How to provision [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) to issue SSH host & user certificates.
* How to configure `sshd` to accept user certs for client authentication using a CA key.
* How to configure `sshd` to present a host cert for host authentication on the client-side.
* How to configure a user's `ssh` to accept host certs signed by a CA key.

If you haven't already you should [read our blog post](https://smallstep.com/blog/use-ssh-certificates/) on why ssh certificates let you achieve de facto SSH Single Sign-on while doing away with pesky public key management across your server fleet.

The code in this repo comes with a pre-generated PKI. You will need `step` v0.12.0+ installed. It will use the popular tool [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) to provision a ssh certificate enabled VM.

## Setup VM

With Vagrant installed run following commands inside the repo:

```
$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'testhost' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> testhost: Importing base box 'ubuntu/bionic64'...
    [...]
==> testhost: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
    testhost: Adapter 1: nat
    testhost: Adapter 2: hostonly
==> testhost: Forwarding ports...
    testhost: 22 (guest) => 2222 (host) (adapter 1)
==> testhost: Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...
==> testhost: Booting VM...
==> testhost: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
    testhost: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
    testhost: SSH username: vagrant

    [...]

    testhost: Add a /etc/hosts file entry `testhost` to resolve to 192.168.0.101
    testhost: Check out README.md to learn how to grab user ssh certs to log into testhost
```

### Configure ssh client to accept host certs

Go ahead and follow the instructions printed by Vagrant. This will allow your local ssh client to accept SSH host certificates signed by the private key that matches the public key specified here. Following command will append the ssh host CA to your local `known_hosts` file:

```
$ echo "@cert-authority * ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBJJM+jkIdieQvdPb8DwnfnJudEc9PgVBqLDWHKgvqoIiMXhuIyGstQ9ULOBMdJkqxMjkRTFZp1iFvIk+iU6hwTA=" >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

You can also find the SSH CA key for host stored at `step/certs/ssh_host_key.pub` in this repo.

Certificates bind names to public keys. In the case of this SSH host cert it's issued for `testhost` which is why we have to add the following entry to your local `/etc/hosts` file:

```
$ tail -n 1 /etc/hosts
192.168.0.101   testhost
```

### Configure sshd to accept user certs

What Vagrant has already done for you is configure `sshd` on `testhost`, the VM generated by Vagrant. Please note that for demo purposes the PKI is shared with the VM using a shared directory mount. Below you can see the relevant lines from the `testhost` VM's `sshd_config`:

```
vagrant@testhost:~$ tail -n 5 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#       PermitTTY no
#       ForceCommand cvs server
TrustedUserCAKeys /keys/ssh_user_key.pub
HostKey /keys/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
HostCertificate /keys/ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub
```

### Login to VM via SSH user cert
To log into the `testhost` VM we will need to grab a valid user certificate via `step ssh certificate` which will fetch it from your SSH-CA-enabled instance of [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) like so...

In one terminal window run following command (password is `password`):
```
$ export STEPPATH=`pwd`/step
$ step-ca step/config/ca.json
Please enter the password to decrypt step/secrets/intermediate_ca_key: password
Please enter the password to decrypt step/secrets/ssh_host_key: password
Please enter the password to decrypt step/secrets/ssh_user_key: password
2019/09/11 22:59:01 Serving HTTPS on :443 ...
```

In another terminal window run this:
```
$ export STEPPATH=`pwd`/step
$ step ssh certificate testuser testuser_ecdsa
step ssh certificate testuser testuser_ecdsa
✔ Provisioner: admin (JWK) [kid: ux6AhkfzgclpI65xJeGHzNqHCmdCl0-nWO8YqF1mcn0]
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key: password
✔ CA: https://localhost
Please enter the password to encrypt the private key: your-own-password
✔ Private Key: testuser_ecdsa
✔ Public Key: testuser_ecdsa.pub
✔ Certificate: testuser_ecdsa-cert.pub
✔ SSH Agent: yes
```

Conveniently `step` CLI add your SSH user cert to your local `ssh agent`. Now you will be able to login up until four hours later (default) when the cert expires.

```
$ ssh-add -l
256 SHA256:xt5VeMEG8uf+SBlddauylJHv9+Bl0E6H+46AV94+Its testuser (ECDSA-CERT)

$ ssh testuser@testhost
ssh testuser@testhost
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-55-generic x86_64)

[...]

testuser@testhost:~$
```

Boom! As you can see the `testhost` VM will welcome you with a matching `testuser@testhost` prompt.

### Generate ssh host certificates

This example repo includes a pre-generated ssh host cert & key. To replace it or generate SSH certs for other hosts running following command:

```
$ step ssh certificate --host --principal testhost \
  --principal testhost.internal \
  testhost ssh_host_ecdsa_key
```

Where `--principal` identifies the hostnames (ideally FQDNs) for the machine. For a single principal you can short cut the command to:

```
$ step ssh certificate --host testhost ssh_host_ecdsa_key
```

## Generate your own PKI for `step-ca` 

We recommend using your own PKI for usage outside of this example. You can initialize your [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) with both x509 and ssh certs with the following command:

```
$ export STEPPATH=/tmp/mystep
$ step ca init --ssh
✔ What would you like to name your new PKI? (e.g. Smallstep): Smallstep
✔ What DNS names or IP addresses would you like to add to your new CA? (e.g. ca.smallstep.com[,1.1.1.1,etc.]): localhost
✔ What address will your new CA listen at? (e.g. :443): :443
✔ What would you like to name the first provisioner for your new CA? (e.g. you@smallstep.com): admin
✔ What do you want your password to be? [leave empty and we'll generate one]:

Generating root certificate...
all done!

Generating intermediate certificate...

Generating user and host SSH certificate signing keys...
all done!

✔ Root certificate: /tmp/mystep/certs/root_ca.crt
✔ Root private key: /tmp/mystep/secrets/root_ca_key
✔ Root fingerprint: d601c93a6256080e42cf02087fdc737f1429226ada6c040bac6494332e01527e
✔ Intermediate certificate: /tmp/mystep/certs/intermediate_ca.crt
✔ Intermediate private key: /tmp/mystep/secrets/intermediate_ca_key
✔ SSH user root certificate: /tmp/mystep/certs/ssh_user_key.pub
✔ SSH user root private key: /tmp/mystep/secrets/ssh_user_key
✔ SSH host root certificate: /tmp/mystep/certs/ssh_host_key.pub
✔ SSH host root private key: /tmp/mystep/secrets/ssh_host_key
✔ Default configuration: /tmp/mystep/config/defaults.json
✔ Certificate Authority configuration: /tmp/mystep/config/ca.json

Your PKI is ready to go. To generate certificates for individual services see 'step help ca'.
```

Now you can launch your instance of [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) with your own PKI like so:

```
$ step-ca $(step path)/config/ca.json
Please enter the password to decrypt /tmp/mystep/secrets/intermediate_ca_key:
Please enter the password to decrypt /tmp/mystep/secrets/ssh_host_key:
Please enter the password to decrypt /tmp/mystep/secrets/ssh_user_key:
2019/09/11 23:34:13 Serving HTTPS on :443 ...
```

Please note that after you regenerate `ssh_host_key.pub` and `ssh_user_key.pub` you will have to reconfigure `ssh` and `sshd` for user and on hosts to accept the new CA keys.

# step-ssh-example
This repo contains a showcase of how to use ssh certificates (for hosts & users) generated by [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) using the `step` CLI's `ssh` sub-command. It will show:

* How to provision [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) to issue SSH host & user certificates.
* How to configure `sshd` to accept user certs for client authentication using a CA key.
* How to configure `sshd` to present a host cert for host authentication on the client side.
* How to configure a user's `ssh` to accept host certs sigend by a CA key.

If you haven't already you should [read our blog](https://smallstep.com/blog) why ssh certificates let you achieve de facto SSH Single Sign-on while doing away with pesky public key management across your server fleet.

The code in this repo comes with a pre-generated PKI. You will need `step` v0.12.0+ installed. It will use the popular tool [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) to provision a ssh certificate enabled VM.

## Setup VM

With Vagrant installed run following commands inside the repo:

```
$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'testhost' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> testhost: Importing base box 'ubuntu/bionic64'...
    [...]
==> testhost: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
    testhost: Adapter 1: nat
    testhost: Adapter 2: hostonly
==> testhost: Forwarding ports...
    testhost: 22 (guest) => 2222 (host) (adapter 1)
==> testhost: Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...
==> testhost: Booting VM...
==> testhost: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
    testhost: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
    testhost: SSH username: vagrant
    testhost: SSH auth method: private key
    testhost: VirtualBox Version: 6.0
    [...]
==> testhost: Setting hostname...
==> testhost: Configuring and enabling network interfaces...
==> testhost: Mounting shared folders...
    testhost: /keys => /Users/sourishkrout/dev/src/smallstep/code/src/github.com/smallstep/step-examples/ssh-example/keys
    testhost: /vagrant => /Users/sourishkrout/dev/src/smallstep/code/src/github.com/smallstep/step-examples/ssh-example
==> testhost: Running provisioner: shell...
    testhost: Running: inline script
    testhost: Add following line to your local hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts file to accept host certs
    testhost: @cert-authority * ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBJJM+jkIdieQvdPb8DwnfnJudEc9PgVBqLDWHKgvqoIiMXhuIyGstQ9ULOBMdJkqxMjkRTFZp1iFvIk+iU6hwTA=
    testhost: Add a /etc/hosts file entry `testhost` to resolve to 192.168.0.101
    testhost: Check out README.md to learn how to grab user ssh certs to log into testhost
```

### Configure ssh client to accept host certs
Then go ahead and follow the instructions printed by Vagrant. This will allow your local ssh client to accept SSH host certificates signed by the private key that matches the public key specified here.

```
$ echo "@cert-authority * ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBJJM+jkIdieQvdPb8DwnfnJudEc9PgVBqLDWHKgvqoIiMXhuIyGstQ9ULOBMdJkqxMjkRTFZp1iFvIk+iU6hwTA=" >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

You will find the SSH CA key for host stored at `step/certs/ssh_host_key.pub` in this repo.

### Configure ssh server to accept user certs
What Vagrant has already done for you is configure `sshd` on `testhost`, the VM generated by Vagrant. Please note that for demo purposes the PKI is shared with the VM using a shared directory mount.

```
vagrant@testhost:~$ tail -n 5 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#       PermitTTY no
#       ForceCommand cvs server
TrustedUserCAKeys /keys/ssh_user_key.pub
HostKey /keys/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
HostCertificate /keys/ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub
```
